# Verve-Inspired Event Landing Page (React + Bootstrap)

This is a responsive, single-page event landing site inspired by the Verve Management website. It's built using **React** and **Bootstrap 5**, focusing on clean UI, dynamic content rendering, and modular components.

## 🔥 Features

- **Hero Section** with background image and overlaid navbar
- **Upcoming Events Section** styled as event cards
- **Add Event Modal** to manually add new events dynamically
- Events added through the modal immediately appear in the **Upcoming Events** list
- Fully responsive and styled to match the look and feel of real-world event websites
